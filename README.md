# ReferenceManager üõ†Ô∏è
A F# console app to replace PackageReferences with ProjectReferences in an entire solution.

# Why?
Imagine the following situation, you have several NuGet libraries and projects that depend on them. When you need to debug the NuGet library in multiple projects of a solution, you will need to manually remove and add the reference for each project. The purpose of this application is to automate this process.
# Limitations
- Only solutions with projects with the new SDK style are supported. (Sad for me too, because I created this project thinking about non-SDK projects üò¢)
- For now, only SDK-style .csprojs are supported for the ProjectReference input. If you need .vbproj and .fsproj support, you can ask me for this improvement or make a pull request
